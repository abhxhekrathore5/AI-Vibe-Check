### 🧐 What is this?
This repository is a **self-updating dashboard** that tracks the emotional state of the developer community. 

It's not accurate tho :D but it's fun


Every 8 hours, a GitHub Action wakes up and:
1.  **Scrapes** the top headlines from Hacker News, r/programming, r/ArtificialIntelligence, and Dev.to.
2.  **Feeds** the chaos into a cynical AI.
3.  **Calculates** a "Developer Anxiety Index" (0-100).
4.  **Generates** a snarky commentary and updates the SVG dashboard above.

### 🚀 Add this to your GitHub Profile
